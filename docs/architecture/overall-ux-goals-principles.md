# Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Primary Persona - Technical Leadership (Directors/VPs of Engineering):**
- 7-15 years experience, managing 3-8 teams
- Frustrated with current Scrum dysfunction, seeking both process improvements and team engagement
- Need to demonstrate technical competency to business stakeholders
- Want to rekindle joy in technical work through meaningful collaboration

**Secondary Persona - Development Team Members (Developers & QA):**
- 2-10 years experience, currently excluded from early requirements collaboration
- Range from skeptical senior developers to QA engineers seeking quality partnership
- Want meaningful input in technical solution design and authentic learning opportunities
- Need ownership and creative input in solutions they implement

**Tertiary Persona - Business Stakeholders:**
- Need to evaluate methodology effectiveness and technical team capabilities
- Want confidence in both planning approach and delivery outcomes
- Require clear visibility into development progress and decision-making

### Usability Goals

1. **Methodology Transparency:** Stakeholders can understand collaborative planning value within 5 minutes of demo
2. **Technical Sophistication Display:** Advanced features are prominently visible and impressive to technical audiences
3. **Effortless Analytics Access:** Users can access meaningful productivity insights with zero learning curve
4. **Collaborative Decision Visibility:** All stakeholders can see and understand their contributions to project decisions
5. **Professional Demonstration Ready:** Interface impresses business stakeholders during methodology presentations

### Design Principles

1. **Showcase Over Simplicity:** Unlike typical apps that hide complexity, prominently display technical sophistication to demonstrate team capabilities
2. **Transparency as Feature:** Make collaborative planning processes visible and central to the experience, not hidden
3. **Dual-Audience Design:** Serve both daily users AND demonstration audiences with equal priority
4. **Data-Driven Confidence:** Use analytics and metrics prominently to build stakeholder confidence in both app and methodology
5. **Methodology Integration:** Every interface element should either support task management OR demonstrate collaborative planning value
