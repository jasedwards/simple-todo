## Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH Priority:**

- **Analytics Data Model Specification:** Epic 2 would benefit from more detailed data schema specification for behavioral analytics and pattern recognition algorithms
- **Methodology Integration Timeline:** Epic 3 implementation timing relative to demonstration milestones could be clarified
  **MEDIUM Priority:**
- **Performance Testing Scope:** Specific performance testing scenarios for analytics workloads could be detailed
- **Decision Log Integration:** How decision logging integrates with development workflow during Epic 1 could be specified

## MVP Scope Assessment

- **Appropriately Sized:** Three-epic structure balances comprehensive demonstration with 2-3 week timeline
- **Strong Value Delivery:** Each epic delivers independent value while building toward complete methodology showcase
- **No Scope Reduction Needed:** Current scope appropriately minimal while maintaining viability for stakeholder demonstration
- **Timeline Realistic:** Epic sequencing supports incremental delivery and early stakeholder validation

## Technical Readiness

- **Excellent Technology Stack Clarity:** Angular/Node.js/PostgreSQL choices well-justified and documented
- **Clear Performance Targets:** Specific metrics (2-second loads, 100ms queries) enable architectural planning
- **Identified Architecture Areas:** Monorepo structure, modular services, and extensibility needs clearly specified
- **Minimal Technical Risk:** Technology choices align with team capabilities and project constraints

## Final Decision

**âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The document demonstrates excellent balance between technical sophistication and methodology demonstration objectives, with clear guidance for implementation team.
