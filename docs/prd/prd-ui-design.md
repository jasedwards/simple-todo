# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a clean, professional interface that showcases technical sophistication while remaining intuitive for stakeholders during methodology demonstrations. The design should feel modern and polished enough to impress business stakeholders while providing developers and QA with clear visibility into collaborative planning processes.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Dashboard-centric approach** with analytics prominently displayed to showcase technical capabilities
- **Status-driven workflow** where task progression (Not Started → In Progress → Stuck → Completed) is visually clear and engaging
- **Transparency-first design** where decision logs and stakeholder contributions are easily accessible and prominently featured
- **Real-time feedback** for analytics updates and collaborative planning activities

## Core Screens and Views

- **Main Dashboard** - Central analytics hub displaying task patterns, completion trends, and productivity insights
- **Task Management Interface** - CRUD operations with enhanced status tracking and visual progression indicators
- **Decision Log View** - Public display of technical choices, trade-offs, and stakeholder input with attribution
- **Analytics Detail Pages** - Deep-dive views into behavioral patterns and completion time analysis
- **Login/Authentication Screen** - Professional entry point for demonstration purposes
