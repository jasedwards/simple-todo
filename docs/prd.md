# BMad Demonstration To-Do App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Demonstrate how collaborative upfront planning prevents late-cycle architectural changes and team dysfunction
• Showcase advanced Node.js/Angular technical capabilities through intelligent task management features
• Transform team dynamics from passive acceptance to active collaboration in requirements and technical decisions
• Prove technical team competency to business stakeholders through both innovative features and transparent methodology
• Restore joy and fulfillment in software development work through meaningful stakeholder participation
• Create reusable BMad methodology artifacts that other teams can adopt for collaborative planning

### Background Context

Software development teams are trapped in dysfunctional Scrum processes where acceptance criteria creation excludes developers and QA engineers from early collaborative planning. This systematic isolation creates a cascade of problems: late-discovery bugs, incorrect estimates, declining team morale, and technical leadership feeling disconnected from the craftsmanship that should define great software development.

The BMad Demonstration To-Do App serves as both a live case study of collaborative methodology and an advanced technical showcase. Unlike traditional productivity tools that treat symptoms, this project addresses root causes by making the planning process itself valuable and visible, while demonstrating sophisticated features like behavioral analytics, completion time correlation, and emotional intelligence systems that emerge when teams are genuinely engaged in solution design from inception.
