## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Core Technologies:**

- **Frontend Language:** TypeScript 5.2+ for type-safe development with fullstack type sharing
- **Frontend Framework:** Angular 20+ with professional SPA capabilities
- **Backend Language:** Node.js 20 LTS for fullstack TypeScript consistency
- **Backend Framework:** Express.js 4.18+ for lightweight API development
- **Build Tools:** Angular CLI 20+ for optimized builds, pnpm for package management
- **Bundler:** esbuild (via Angular) for production builds
- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS 3.3+ for utility-first styling

**Infrastructure:**

- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ as primary data storage
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with JWT-based authentication
- **Deployment:** Vercel CLI for infrastructure deployment
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated deployment pipeline

### Project Structure Alignment

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

The project must follow the monorepo structure:

```
bmad-todo-demo/
├── .github/workflows/          # CI/CD automation
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                    # Angular frontend
│   └── api/                    # Serverless backend
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/                 # Shared types and utilities
│   ├── ui/                     # Shared UI components
│   └── config/                 # Shared configuration
├── infrastructure/             # Infrastructure as Code
├── scripts/                    # Build and deployment scripts
├── docs/                      # Documentation
└── tools/                     # Development tools
```

**File Organization Requirements:**

- Use kebab-case for file and directory names
- Organize imports in specified order (Angular core, Angular libraries, third-party, application)
- Follow dependency injection patterns for services
- All components must use standalone components pattern

### Coding Standards Requirements

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**MANDATORY Requirements:**

- **Signals-Based Architecture:** All state management must use Angular Signals
- **Zoneless Configuration:** Application must run in zoneless mode for optimal performance
- **Change Detection:** All components use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
- **JSDoc Documentation:** All components, services, and interfaces require comprehensive JSDoc

**Git Configuration:**

- Configure .gitignore for Node.js, Angular, and development tools
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality (ESLint, Prettier, type checking)
- Configure commit message standards for collaborative development

### Development Environment Setup

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Required Installations:**

- Node.js 20 LTS with npm/pnpm
- Angular CLI 20+ globally
- Git with proper configuration
- Preferred IDE with TypeScript support

**Configuration Files Needed:**

- `package.json` with workspace configuration
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for monorepo management
- `turbo.json` for build optimization
- `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc` for code quality
- `tsconfig.json` with base TypeScript configuration
- Environment files (`.env.example`, `.env.local.example`)

**Development Scripts:**

- Build scripts for all workspace packages
- Development server scripts
- Linting and formatting scripts
- Testing scripts preparation

### Testing

**Testing Framework Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Frontend Testing:** vitest + Testing Library for unit and integration testing
- **Backend Testing:** Jest + Supertest for API and service testing
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright for end-to-end automation

**Environment Verification Tests:**

- Node.js version check (`node --version` returns v20.x.x)
- Package manager verification (`pnpm --version` succeeds)
- Angular CLI installation check (`ng version` returns 20+)
- Git installation and configuration verification

**Project Structure Tests:**

- Verify all required directories exist as per unified structure
- Validate package.json workspace configuration
- Test build scripts execution (`pnpm build` succeeds)
- Verify .gitignore includes all necessary exclusions

**Code Quality Tests:**

- ESLint configuration validates against coding standards
- Pre-commit hooks execute successfully
- TypeScript compilation passes with strict settings
- Prettier formatting rules apply correctly

**Success Criteria Verification:**

- **AC1:** Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore and initial commit
- **AC2:** GitHub project board accessible with all required columns and workflow
- **AC3:** Development environment builds and serves successfully without errors

**Build Verification Steps:**

- `pnpm install` completes without errors
- `pnpm build` produces expected output in correct directories
- `pnpm start` launches development server on expected port
- All workspace packages compile and link successfully

**Test Organization:**

- Unit tests co-located with source files (`.spec.ts` suffix)
- Integration tests in dedicated test directories
- E2E tests in separate test suites
- Test configuration files in packages/config/jest/

**Testing Standards:**

- All public APIs must have unit tests
- Components require comprehensive signal-based testing
- Services need integration tests with HTTP client mocking
- Test files must follow same naming conventions as source files
