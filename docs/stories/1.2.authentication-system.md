# Epic 1.1 â€“ Story 1.2: Authentication System

**Story:**
As a user, I want to securely register and log in to the application, so that my data is protected.

**Tasks:**

- Implement user registration (frontend form, backend endpoint, Supabase integration).
- Implement user login (frontend form, backend endpoint, Supabase integration).
- Set up password recovery (frontend flow, backend logic, Supabase support).
- Enforce input validation and sanitization on all authentication forms.
- Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all authentication-related endpoints.
- Add audit logging for registration, login, and password recovery actions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can register with email and password; registration is validated and stored securely.
- Users can log in and receive a session token; session management is handled securely.
- Users can initiate password recovery and reset their password via email.
- All authentication flows validate and sanitize user input.
- All authentication endpoints are only accessible via HTTPS.
- Audit logs are generated for registration, login, and password recovery events.
- Application will run in dev mode by mocking authentication

**Technical Notes:**

- Use Supabase Auth for authentication and password recovery.
- Use shared TypeScript interfaces for user data models.
- Store audit logs in PostgreSQL via Supabase.
- Follow TypeScript best practices and modular architecture.
- implement a test mode so that we can test without real credentials. you can do this by checking if in dev mode

**QA Results:**

Requirements Traceability (Given-When-Then):

1. Registration

   - Given a user provides a valid email and password
   - When the user submits the registration form
   - Then the system validates input, stores credentials securely, and creates an audit log

2. Login

   - Given a registered user provides valid credentials
   - When the user submits the login form
   - Then the system authenticates, issues a session token, and creates an audit log

3. Password Recovery

   - Given a user initiates password recovery
   - When the user submits their email for recovery
   - Then the system sends a reset link, allows password reset, and creates an audit log

4. Input Validation & Sanitization

   - Given a user interacts with any authentication form
   - When the user submits data
   - Then the system validates and sanitizes all input

5. HTTPS Enforcement

   - Given any authentication endpoint is accessed
   - When a request is made
   - Then the endpoint is only accessible via HTTPS

6. Audit Logging

   - Given a registration, login, or password recovery event occurs
   - When the event is processed
   - Then an audit log entry is created in PostgreSQL via Supabase

7. Dev Mode Authentication Mocking
   - Given the application is running in dev mode
   - When authentication is required
   - Then authentication is mocked and no real credentials are used
