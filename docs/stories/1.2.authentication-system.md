# Epic 1.1 â€“ Story 1.2: Authentication System

[Status: Approved]

**Story:**
As a user, I want to securely register and log in to the application, so that my data is protected.

**Tasks:**

- Implement user registration (frontend form, backend endpoint, Supabase integration).
- Implement user login (frontend form, backend endpoint, Supabase integration).
- Set up password recovery (frontend flow, backend logic, Supabase support).
- Enforce input validation and sanitization on all authentication forms.
- Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all authentication-related endpoints.
- Add audit logging for registration, login, and password recovery actions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can register with email and password; registration is validated and stored securely.
- Users can log in and receive a session token; session management is handled securely.
- Users can initiate password recovery and reset their password via email.
- All authentication flows validate and sanitize user input.
- All authentication endpoints are only accessible via HTTPS.
- Audit logs are generated for registration, login, and password recovery events.
- Application will run in dev mode by mocking authentication

**Technical Notes:**

- Use Supabase Auth for authentication and password recovery.
- Use shared TypeScript interfaces for user data models.
- Store audit logs in PostgreSQL via Supabase.
- Follow TypeScript best practices and modular architecture.
- implement a test mode so that we can test without real credentials. you can do this by checking if in dev mode

[Dev Notes]

- All authentication features will be implemented in `apps/simple-todo/src/app/auth/` for frontend and `apps/simple-todo-backend/src/auth/` for backend.
- Shared TypeScript interfaces for user data models will be placed in `packages/shared/types.ts`.
- Supabase integration will use environment variables for credentials, with dev mode mocking in place.
- Audit logs will be stored in PostgreSQL via Supabase, table: `audit_logs`.
- UI components: RegistrationForm, LoginForm, PasswordRecoveryForm (Angular components in `src/app/auth/`).
- All endpoints will be exposed via HTTPS only (enforced in backend config).
- Follow coding standards from `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` and tech stack from `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`.

[Testing]

- Test files located in `apps/simple-todo/src/app/auth/` and `apps/simple-todo-backend/src/auth/`.
- Use Vitest for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E tests.
- Test scenarios as listed in QA Results section must be covered.
- Mock authentication flows in dev mode for testing.

**QA Results:**

Requirements Traceability (Given-When-Then):

1. Registration

   - Given a user provides a valid email and password
   - When the user submits the registration form
   - Then the system validates input, stores credentials securely, and creates an audit log

2. Login

   - Given a registered user provides valid credentials
   - When the user submits the login form
   - Then the system authenticates, issues a session token, and creates an audit log

3. Password Recovery

   - Given a user initiates password recovery
   - When the user submits their email for recovery
   - Then the system sends a reset link, allows password reset, and creates an audit log

4. Input Validation & Sanitization

   - Given a user interacts with any authentication form
   - When the user submits data
   - Then the system validates and sanitizes all input

5. HTTPS Enforcement

   - Given any authentication endpoint is accessed
   - When a request is made
   - Then the endpoint is only accessible via HTTPS

6. Audit Logging

   - Given a registration, login, or password recovery event occurs
   - When the event is processed
   - Then an audit log entry is created in PostgreSQL via Supabase

7. Dev Mode Authentication Mocking
   - Given the application is running in dev mode
   - When authentication is required
   - Then authentication is mocked and no real credentials are used

Comprehensive Test Scenarios:

1. Registration

   - Valid registration (new email, strong password)
   - Registration with invalid email format
   - Registration with weak password
   - Registration with existing email
   - Registration with missing fields
   - Registration in dev mode (mocked)

2. Login

   - Valid login (correct credentials)
   - Login with incorrect password
   - Login with unregistered email
   - Login with missing fields
   - Login in dev mode (mocked)

3. Password Recovery

   - Initiate recovery with registered email
   - Initiate recovery with unregistered email
   - Reset password with valid token
   - Reset password with invalid/expired token
   - Recovery in dev mode (mocked)

4. Input Validation & Sanitization

   - Submit forms with script injection attempts
   - Submit forms with SQL injection attempts
   - Submit forms with excessive length inputs
   - Submit forms with empty fields

5. HTTPS Enforcement

   - Attempt to access endpoints via HTTP (should fail)
   - Access endpoints via HTTPS (should succeed)

6. Audit Logging

   - Verify audit log entry for registration
   - Verify audit log entry for login
   - Verify audit log entry for password recovery
   - Verify audit logs are stored in PostgreSQL

7. Dev Mode Authentication Mocking
   - All authentication flows operate with mocked responses in dev mode
   - No real credentials or Supabase calls in dev mode
