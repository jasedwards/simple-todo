# Epic 1.1 â€“ Story 1.2: Authentication System

**Story:**
As a user, I want to securely register and log in to the application, so that my data is protected.

**Tasks:**

- Implement user registration (frontend form, backend endpoint, Supabase integration).
- Implement user login (frontend form, backend endpoint, Supabase integration).
- Set up password recovery (frontend flow, backend logic, Supabase support).
- Enforce input validation and sanitization on all authentication forms.
- Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all authentication-related endpoints.
- Add audit logging for registration, login, and password recovery actions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can register with email and password; registration is validated and stored securely.
- Users can log in and receive a session token; session management is handled securely.
- Users can initiate password recovery and reset their password via email.
- All authentication flows validate and sanitize user input.
- All authentication endpoints are only accessible via HTTPS.
- Audit logs are generated for registration, login, and password recovery events.
- Application will run in dev mode by mocking authentication

**Technical Notes:**

- Use Supabase Auth for authentication and password recovery.
- Use shared TypeScript interfaces for user data models.
- Store audit logs in PostgreSQL via Supabase.
- Follow TypeScript best practices and modular architecture.
- implement a test mode so that we can test without real credentials. you can do this by checking if in dev mode
